# Practicals

During the first three weeks of the NST Part 1B Mathematical and Computational Biology subject we will be learning 
Python programming and foundational data techniques that are useful not just for this course but also beyond. These core
concepts are used and applied throughout the whole Mathematical and Computational Biology course.  Understanding these 
are key to be able to follow the rest of the course.

### Earn your badge each week
In the programming world, many organisations award badges to learners on the acquisition of a new skill or completion of 
a milestone. If you attempted and solved all the exercises of each practical, you will earn a badge. By the end of week 
three you will have earned the 3-star badge {octicon}`star-fill;1em;sd-text-warning` 
{octicon}`star-fill;1em;sd-text-warning` {octicon}`star-fill;1em;sd-text-warning` that marks the end of the MCB Python practicals.   
Below are the links of each practical sheet that we will be working on each week.
