# Getting started with Matplotlib

In this section we are going to get started with drawing plots from lists using the `matplotlib` package. 
`matplotlib` is the most widely used package for visualising data in Python [^python-survey].


## Importing Matplotlib
Like NumPy Matplotlib should also be present in the Anaconda distribution (check the Python Packages tab in PyCharm).

To import matplotlib in your code use the following code:
```{code-cell} ipython3
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

## Drawing our first plot

Let us start by drawing a simple line plot:  

```{code-cell} ipython3
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# values of x and y points

x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
y = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

plt.plot(x, y)
plt.xlabel("x-axis")
plt.ylabel("y-axis")
plt.show()
```

In the code above, `x` and `y` represent the coordinates to plot on our plot.  The `plot()` function takes as an argument 
the x and y coordinates to plot (see [documentation](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.plot.html)).
`plt.xlabel()` sets the title of the x-axis label, and similarly `plt.ylabel()` sets the title of the y-axis label. 
Calling `plt.plot(x,y)` on its own will not plot the plot for us. To visualise the plot we need to call the `plt.show()` function.

When you run the code above in PyCharm you can see the output of this plot in the SciView tool window on the right hand side in the 
Plots view.

```{figure} images/plots-view-pycharm.png

name: plots-view-pycharm
width: 50%

```
If this is not visible click *View > Scientific mode* from PyCharm's menu to enable it.

You can also use `plt.plot()` to plot markers on the plot.  To do this you need to use the `fmt` parameter 
that takes as an input a format string that specifies the type of marker you want to plot.  The syntax of the format string
originates from MATLAB which concatenates a colour string with a line style string.  The code below shows an example of plotting 
the same (x,y) coordinates in the previous plot but this time using red circle markers:

```{code-cell} ipython3
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
y = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

plt.plot(y, x, "ro")
plt.xlabel("x-axis")
plt.ylabel("y-axis")
plt.show()
```

There is a vast list of string formats you can specify that generate different markers.  A whole list of format strings supported can be found [here](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.plot.html) at the bottom 
of the page in the **Notes** section.  

```{exercise-start} Draw dotted line plot with markers
:label: line-plot
```

**Level:** {octicon}`star-fill;1em;sd-text-warning` {octicon}`star-fill;1em;sd-text-warning` {octicon}`star;1em;sd-text-warning`

```{code-block}
x = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
y = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```
Using the `x` and `y` coordinates above, draw a plot with green circle markers joined together with a dashed line as shown below.  The plot should 
look like this:
```{image} images/green-dotted-plot.png
:width: 60%
```
```{exercise-end}
```

`plt.plot()` is only used to plot x and y coordinates as lines or markers.  If you want to plot something else, you need to use 
a different plot.  You can see a list of the different plots supported in Matplotlib [here](https://matplotlib.org/stable/plot_types/index.html). 

```{exercise} Plotting a scatter plot
:label: scatter-plot

**Level:** {octicon}`star-fill;1em;sd-text-warning` {octicon}`star-fill;1em;sd-text-warning` {octicon}`star;1em;sd-text-warning`

Generate 20 random numbers from 0 to 1, and set these as your x and y values.  Plot these on a scatter plot.

```


This section was a gentle introduction, we will be plotting more with Matplotlib in next week's practical.
