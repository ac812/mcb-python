### Python Console

You can interact with the Python interpreter via the Python Console pane at the bottom of PyCharm's screen (as shown below).

The console displays `>>>` to indicate that it is expecting a command as an input. After writing the command, pressing 
the `<Enter>` key will execute the command.  The output of the command is then displayed in the console.

A good way to use the Python Console is to use it as a calculator.
