# Practical 2
# Further programming in Python

## Aim  
The aim of this practical is to build upon the Python syntax and concepts we learn in [Practical 1](practical1) and explore
further programming concepts and Python functionality.

## Objectives
During this practical you will learn how to:
* create your own functions
* use NumPy arrays and perform different operations with them


## Instructions

The best way to do this practical is to read the associated notes which will introduce you to the core concepts of Python programming. 
These notes are designed with all the details you would need to be able to perform the exercises in this practical. In 
general, you would not need to refer to additional texts and resources as these notes have been explained in detail with
accompanying visual aids and examples to explain concepts to beginners.  Apart from the exercises listed below, there are also 
examples throughout the notes which provide insight on the concepts introduced, and therefore, it is recommended that you also 
run these examples as you progress through the practical notes.  

**If you are an experienced Python programmer**, you might find that you already know about the content in these notes. You 
may want to skip sections of notes that you already know and attempt the exercises that are at the higher levels. 

### Exercises levels
Exercises in this practical are labelled with the level of difficulty of the respective exercise:

```{list-table}
:header-rows: 1

* - Level
  - Description
* - {octicon}`star-fill;1em;sd-text-warning` {octicon}`star;1em;sd-text-warning` {octicon}`star;1em;sd-text-warning`
  - **Level 1**:  Excercises in Level 1 are simple excersises designed to get you familiar with the Python syntax.  If you already know how to program in Python, you may skip these exercises.
* - {octicon}`star-fill;1em;sd-text-warning` {octicon}`star-fill;1em;sd-text-warning` {octicon}`star;1em;sd-text-warning`
  - **Level 2**: Excercises in Level 2 combine different Python programming concepts to solve simple problems.  
* - {octicon}`star-fill;1em;sd-text-warning` {octicon}`star-fill;1em;sd-text-warning` {octicon}`star-fill;1em;sd-text-warning`
  - **Level 3**: Exercises in Level 3 test not just the understanding of the Python syntax but also how Python can be used to solve problems.  
```
