# # 1,500 scientists lift the lid on reproducibility
# 
# ## Survey sheds light on the 'crisis' rocking research.
# ### by Mona Baker
# 
# **More than 70% of researchers have tried and failed to reproduce another scientist's experiments**, and more than half have failed to reproduce their own experiments. Those are some of the telling figures that emerged from *Nature*'s survey of 1,576 researchers who took a brief online questionnaire on reproducibility in research.
# 
# The data reveal sometimes-contradictory attitudes towards reproducibility. Although 52% of those surveyed agree that there is a significant crisis of reproducibility, less than 31% think that failure to reproduce published results means that the result is probably wrong, and most say that they still trust the published literature.

# ### The Survey
# 
# In the survey [^1] respondents were asked to rate 11 different approaches to improving reproducibilty in science.  Below is the list order by the most highly rated:
# 
# * Better understanding of statistics
# * Better mentoring/supervision
# * More robust design
# * Better teaching
# * More within-lab validation
# * Incentives for better practice
# * Incentives for formal reproduction
# * More external-lab validation
# * More time for mentoring
# * Journals enforcing standards
# * More time checking notebooks
