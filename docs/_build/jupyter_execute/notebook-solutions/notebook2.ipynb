    "## Survey sheds light on the 'crisis' rocking research.\n",
    "### by Mona Baker\n",
    "\n",
    "**More than 70% of researchers have tried and failed to reproduce another scientist's experiments**, and more than half have failed to reproduce their own experiments. Those are some of the telling figures that emerged from *Nature*'s survey of 1,576 researchers who took a brief online questionnaire on reproducibility in research.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data reveal sometimes-contradictory attitudes towards reproducibility. Although 52% of those surveyed agree that there is a significant crisis of reproducibility, less than 31% think that failure to reproduce published results means that the result is probably wrong, and most say that they still trust the published literature.\n",

    "In the survey respondents were asked to rate 11 different approaches to improving reproducibilty in science.  Below is the list order by the most highly rated:\n",
