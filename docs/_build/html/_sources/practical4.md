# Practical 4
# Jupyter and more

## Aim  
In this practical we will learn how to create and execute Jupyter Notebooks, a way of incorporating natural language with 
code that allows us to explain our code and write notes with our code. We will also look at recursion.

## Objectives
During this practical you will learn how to:
* create and run Jupyter Notebooks with Python code
* write recursive functions

## Instructions

The best way to do this practical is to read the associated notes which will introduce you to the core concepts of Python programming. 
These notes are designed with all the details you would need to be able to perform the exercises in this practical. In 
general, you would not need to refer to additional texts and resources as these notes have been explained in detail with
accompanying visual aids and examples to explain concepts to beginners.  Apart from the exercises listed below, there are also 
examples throughout the notes which provide insight on the concepts introduced, and therefore, it is recommended that you also 
run these examples as you progress through the practical notes.  

**If you are an experienced Python programmer**, you might find that you already know about the content in these notes. You 
may want to skip sections of notes that you already know and attempt the exercises that are at the higher levels. 

### Exercises levels
Exercises in this practical are labelled with the level of difficulty of the respective exercise:

```{list-table}
:header-rows: 1

* - Level
  - Description
* - {octicon}`star-fill;1em;sd-text-warning` {octicon}`star;1em;sd-text-warning` {octicon}`star;1em;sd-text-warning`
  - **Level 1**:  Excercises in Level 1 are simple excersises designed to get you familiar with the Python syntax.  If you already know how to program in Python, you may skip these exercises.
* - {octicon}`star-fill;1em;sd-text-warning` {octicon}`star-fill;1em;sd-text-warning` {octicon}`star;1em;sd-text-warning`
  - **Level 2**: Excercises in Level 2 combine different Python programming concepts to solve simple problems.  
* - {octicon}`star-fill;1em;sd-text-warning` {octicon}`star-fill;1em;sd-text-warning` {octicon}`star-fill;1em;sd-text-warning`
  - **Level 3**: Exercises in Level 3 test not just the understanding of the Python syntax but also how Python can be used to solve problems.  
```

```{admonition} Next steps
To be profecient in a programming language you need to practice a lot!

After the course:
 * go over the notes again and make sure you know the core concepts introduced in this course.  
 * follow this by looking into other online resources to practice more python, for example, you should have free access to [Linked-in learning](http://www.cam.ac.uk/linkedinlearning) as a member of the Univeristy of Cambridge, 
 a resource with many tutorials and courses.
 * the upcoming lectures and practicals will continue to introduce you to ways on how you can explore biological data with Python.
 
Happy Python practicing!
