# Visualising data with Matplotlib

Now that we have learned how to slice our data let us start visualising it.  We have already seen [previously](plots_lists.md) 
how to plot simple plots.  Here we will be looking at more examples of how to visualise data with `matplotlib`.

## Visualising Pandas data structures in Matplotlib
The authors of Matplotlib recommend that NumPy arrays are used as an input to Matplotlib functions. They also mention 
that if Pandas data structures are used, it might not work as intended and therefore recommend to convert these to
NumPy arrays before plotting [^refmatplotlib].

Let us start by plotting one of the columns from our DataFrame as a line plot:

```{code-cell} ipython3
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# read data from file to DataFrame 
df = pd.read_csv("data/world-bank-1_data.csv")

#plot life expectancy
df["life_expectancy_t"].plot()
plt.show()
```
