# Visualising data with Matplotlib

Now that we have learned how to slice our data let us start visualising it.  We have already seen [previously](plots_lists.md) 
how to plot simple plots.  Here we will be looking at more examples of how to visualise data with `matplotlib`.

## Visualising Pandas data structures in Matplotlib
The authors of Matplotlib recommend that NumPy arrays are used as an input to Matplotlib functions. They also mention 
that if Pandas data structures are used, it might not work as intended and therefore recommend to convert these to
NumPy arrays before plotting [^refmatplotlib].

Let us start by plotting one of the columns from our DataFrame as a line plot:

```{code-cell} ipython3
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# read data from file to DataFrame 
df = pd.read_csv("data/world-bank-1_data.csv")

#plot life expectancy
df["life_expectancy_t"].plot()
plt.show()
```

The `plot()` method from Pandas provides us with an efficient way of plotting Pandas data using Matplotlib functionality. 
The same process can be used to plot different kinds of plot in Pandas.  Below are a few examples.

```{code-cell} ipython3
# scatter plot
df.plot.scatter(x="life_expectancy_f", y ="life_expectancy_m")
plt.show()
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
# box plot
df.plot.box(column="life_expectancy_t")
plt.show()
```

If you have categorical data in your dataset, and you want to create individual boxplots for each category you can do this via
the `by` argument of the `plot.box()` method.  Below is an example.  To find out more wha

````{code-cell} ipython3
df.plot.box(by="year", column="life_expectancy_t", figsize=(10,8), xlabel="years", ylabel="life expectancy")
plt.show()
````

## Saving image to file
To save a plot to an image file use the `savefig()` function from `matplotlib.pyplot`.  Create a folder `output` in your PyCharm project.  We want to save the 
plot in this `output` folder.

```{code-cell} ipython3
df.plot.box(by="year", column="life_expectancy_t", figsize=(10,8), xlabel="years", ylabel="life expectancy")
plt.savefig("output/boxplot.jpg")
```
Now go into the output folder and see if the image is there!

```

**Level:** {octicon}`star-fill;1em;sd-text-warning` {octicon}`star;1em;sd-text-warning` {octicon}`star;1em;sd-text-warning`

In the code used in this section we have mainly looked at plotting life expectancy.
1. Practice by running the code above.
2. Plot the same plots but this time use the column `co2_emissions_pc` as the main variable in the plots

```{exercise-end}
```


```{exercise-start} Highlighting selected points
:label: highlight_scatter
```

**Level:** {octicon}`star-fill;1em;sd-text-warning` {octicon}`star-fill;1em;sd-text-warning` {octicon}`star;1em;sd-text-warning`

Create a scatter plot with life expactancy on the x-axis and co2 emissions on the y-axis.  Highlight the points where
co2_emissions are greater than 40 in red.

**Hint**:  Use the `plt.subplots()` to create a figure and only one subplot.

```{exercise-end}
```
