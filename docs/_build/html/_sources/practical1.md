# Getting started with Python Programming

## Aim  
The aim of this practical is to learn the Python programming language syntax and its core programming concepts and 
how to use them.  It is the first step in learning Python programming.  

## Objectives
During this practical you will learn how to:
* create a project and a Python program in PyCharm
* define variables
* use different data types in Python
* use different data structures in Python and perform different operations with them
* how to call functions
* use different control flow statements: if statement, for and while loops to control flow of code execution
* how to find help


## Instructions

The best way to do this practical is to read these notes which will introduce you to the core concepts of Python programming. 
These notes are designed with all the details you would need to be able to perform the exercises in this practical. In 
general, you would not need to refer to additional texts and resources as these notes have been explained in detail with
accompanying visual aids and examples to explain concepts to beginners.  Apart from the exercises listed below, there are also 
examples throughout the notes which provide insight on the concepts introduced, and therefore, it is recommended that you also 
run these examples as you progress through the practical notes.  

**If you are an experienced Python programmer**, you might find that you already know about the content in these notes. You 
may want to skip sections of notes that you already know and attempt the exercises that are at the higher levels. 

### Exercises levels
Exercises in this practical are labelled with the level of difficulty of the respective exercise:

```{list-table}
:header-rows: 1

* - Level
  - Description
* - {octicon}`star-fill;1em;sd-text-warning` {octicon}`star;1em;sd-text-warning` {octicon}`star;1em;sd-text-warning`
  - **Level 1**:  Excercises in Level 1 are simple excersises designed to get you familiar with the Python syntax.  If you already know how to program in Python, you may skip these exercises.
* - {octicon}`star-fill;1em;sd-text-warning` {octicon}`star-fill;1em;sd-text-warning` {octicon}`star;1em;sd-text-warning`
  - **Level 2**: Excercises in Level 2 combine different Python programming concepts to solve simple problems.  
* - {octicon}`star-fill;1em;sd-text-warning` {octicon}`star-fill;1em;sd-text-warning` {octicon}`star-fill;1em;sd-text-warning`
  - **Level 3**: Exercises in Level 3 test not just the understanding of the Python syntax but also how Python can be used to solve problems.  
```
