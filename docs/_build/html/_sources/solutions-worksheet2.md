```{solution-start} bubble-sort
:label: bubble-sort-solution
:class: dropdown
```
```{code-cell}
def bubble_sort(x):
    """
    Returns the list of integers x in ascending order.
    :param x: list of integers
    :return: the sorted list of integers in ascending order
    """
    k = len(x)
    for i in range(k-1):
        for j in range(k-i-1):
            if(l[j] > l[j+1]):
                l[j], l[j+1] = l[j+1], l[j]
    return l


l = [3, 1, 6, 2, 4]
print(f"Initial list: {l}")
print(f"Sorted list: {bubble_sort(l)}")
```

Note:  there are different versions of optimisations of the bubble sort that I have not included in this solution as it is 
outside the scope of this exercise.  However, if interested please look into *bubble sort algorithm optimisations*.
```{solution-end}
