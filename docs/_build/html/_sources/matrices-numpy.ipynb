    "# Matrices in NumPy\n",
    "\n",
    "Matrices are used in several fields of study, including, mathematics, computer science and engineering.  In this section\n",
    "we will be introducing matrices and the core matrix operations.  We will be doing this using NumPy matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Matrices\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start from the very beginning, by looking at different types of matrices.  \n",
    "* A matrix consisting of a single row is called a **row matrix**.  \n",
    "* A matrix consisting of a single column is called a **column matrix**.  We have already seen this in \n",
    "[Practical 2](numpy.md) where we introduced 1-D NumPy arrays or **vectors**. \n",
    "* A matrix which has $n$ rows and $n$ columns, that is, the same number of rows and columns, is called a **square matrix**. \n",
    "* A matrix which has $n$ rows and $m$ columns, is called a **rectangular matrix**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating a NumPy matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "We create a matrix in NumPy in a similar way we did with a NumPy vector, but using nested lists instead of a list, as follows:\n",

    "{numref}`matrix` above shows a representation of the `ndarray` object created in memory after running the code `m = np.array([[8, 2, 3], [2, 4, 3]])`. \n",
    "In this example, variable `m` points to an `ndarray` object in memory.  The `ndarray` object is composed of different attributes. \n",
    "The data of the `ndarray` object is not stored inside the `ndarray` object, the `ndarray` object points to it. The main difference from \n",
    "the 1D NumPy arrays is mainly in the `shape` attribute, which now stored 2 numbers representing the size of the rows and columns\n",
    "of the matrix respectively.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Matrix products\n",
    "\n",
    "Most matrix operations are similar to those that we have done in practical 2 for vectors.  In this section we look at the \n",
    "dot product multiplication and how to calculate the determinant of a matrix .  I have included details on how these are computed mathematically for those who do not \n",
    "have this background or who would like to refresh it. Please skip these explanations and only look at the python code if you are\n",

    "in green in the figure above, that is, from the sizes above, we know that the product will be of size $2 \\times 2$.\n",
