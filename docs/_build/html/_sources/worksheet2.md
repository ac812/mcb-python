```{exercise} cm to m function
:label: cm-to-m
:nonumber:

**Level:** {octicon}`star-fill;1em;sd-text-warning` {octicon}`star;1em;sd-text-warning` {octicon}`star;1em;sd-text-warning`

Create a function `cm_to_m()` that given a number `n` as an argument, which represents centimeters (cm), will convert that 
number to meters (m).

```{exercise-start} Bubble sort
:label: bubble-sort
:nonumber:

```

In this exercise we are going to practice **nested loops** by coding the bubble sort.  The bubble sort is a simple sorting 
algorithm. To sort a list of numbers, the bubble sort iterates over the numbers in the list.  For each number `l[j]`, 
it compares it with the number next to it `l[j+1]`.  If `l[j]` is bigger than `l[j+1]`, they will swap places, that is,
`l[j+1]` becomes `l[j]` and `l[j]` becomes `l[j+1]`.  This process is repeated for *N* times, where *N* is the length of the list - 1.

Below is an example of the first iteration of the bubble sort algorithm.  Write a `bubble_sort()` function that will implement 
the bubble sort algorithm as explained above.  The function should take a list of numbers as an input and returns 
the sorted list as an output.

```{admonition} Do you know?
:class: tip

The bubble sort is one of the simple sorting algorithms.  Because it is a simple algorithm it is not an efficient one and, 
in fact, it is widely critisised and also a known programmers humour.  [Barack Obama once joked about it too!](https://youtu.be/k4RRi_ntQc8)
