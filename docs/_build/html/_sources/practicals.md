# Practicals

During the first three weeks of the NST Part 1B Mathematical Biology we will be learning Python programming and
foundational data techniques that are useful not just for this course but also beyond. These core concepts are used 
throughout the whole Mathematical and Computational Biology course.


After each practical you will achieve an MCB Python badge.  By the end of week three you will receive the 3-star badge 
{octicon}`star-fill;1em;sd-text-warning` {octicon}`star-fill;1em;sd-text-warning` {octicon}`star-fill;1em;sd-text-warning` 
for the MCB Python practicals.   Below are the links of each practical sheet that we will be working on each week.
