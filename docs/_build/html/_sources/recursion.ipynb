    "We have previously looked at **iteration** (`for` and `while` loops) as the mechanism to repeat a set of statements in our code. We will \n",
    "now be looking at **recursion** which is another way for repeating a set of statements.  A **recursive function** is a function \n",
    "that calls itself. The code below shows an example of a recursive function `sum_to_n()` which adds the numbers from 1 to \n",
    "`n`. For example, when `n` is 4, `sum_to_n(4)` will give the following answer: 1+2+3+4 = 10.\n",

    "A recursive function has the following properties:\n",
    "1. has a based case \n",
    "2. has a general case, that moves towards its base case\n",
    "\n",
    "If a recursive function does not have these properties, then it will continue calling itself until it uses all memory available \n",
    "to it, which is also known as **stack overflow**. The **general case** is a statement that expresses the same problem but in a smaller version of it.  In the code above line 5 is the general case. \n",
    "Here the function is calling itself using the argument `n-1` (smaller version). The **base case** is the statement that terminates recursion, or stopping condition. \n",
    "When `n` is 1, `sum_to_n()` returns 1.  When the base case is reached, the process starts to **unwind**, because since we know\n",
    "the answer of `sum_to_n(1)`, we are now able to compute the answer of the other recursive calls.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever a function is called, an entry is made to the function's **call stack**, known as a **stack frame**. The stack frame contains\n",
    "information about the value of the local variables of the function and the position in the function that was last reached before calling another \n",
    "function.  In this way, the call stack keeps track of the execution of a program. The animation below shows an example of this process\n",
    "using the example code above.\n",

    "In Step 1, the function starts running until it reaches line 5 where it calls itself. A stack frame for the first function \n",
    "call is **pushed** to the call stack. This process is repeated until Step 4. In Step 4, the base case is called and `sum_to_n(1)` is \n",
    "evaluated to 1 and the function terminates.  Because we have an actual value, that stack frame is **popped** and the call stack pointer now moves to the previous stack \n",
    "frame. Control now returns to line 5 at the state in specified in stack frame in Step 5. This can now evalautes to 3 and the return statement in line 5 causes the \n",
    "function to terminate, which then pops the stack frame and moves the pointer to the previous one. This process continues until the call stack is \n",
    "empty which would mean that all the recursive calls have been evaluated and the code in `sum_to_n()` has been executed. An in fact, in step 8, we now have the sum of all numbers up to n which \n",
