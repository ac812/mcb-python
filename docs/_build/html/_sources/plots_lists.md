# Drawing plots from lists - `matplotlib`

In this section we are going to learn how to draw plots from lists using the `matplotlib` package. 
`matplotlib` is the most widely used package for visualising data in Python [^python-survey].

If you have not installed `matplotlib` on your computer before, you would need to install it first.  You can install from 
your terminal, either via pip:

```
pip install matplotlib
```
or via conda:
```
conda install matplotlib
```
